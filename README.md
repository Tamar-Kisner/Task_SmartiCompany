In the task sent to me I was required to work with a database, but because I currently do not have this knowledge, I worked with arrays instead.
The main page allows the user to choose what information he wants to view, about the cars, about the paintings or about the countries.
For each object (car, painting and country) I created 3 components(html, css and ts) including the array of objects, each type of object has its own array.
The array is represented to the user as a table, and he\she can update delete and add.
